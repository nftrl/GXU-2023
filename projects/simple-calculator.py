""" Simple calculator
A simple calculator for simple expressions.
First it takes a binary operator like +, -, * or / and then the two
operands (x and y) to calculate simple expressions like x + y and x / y.

The program might look something like this:

	This is a simple calculator.
	First you input the operator, then the operands one at a time.
	
	Input operator [+-*/]
	> +
	Input x in (x + y)
	> 19
	Input y in (19 + y)
	> 3.4
	Result:
	19 + 3.4 = 22.4


-- STEPS --
Follow the steps underneath to create the program and afterwards implement
the extensions. The steps also serve as a structure for the program.
Feel free to change or add anything you like :)

1. Get operator [+-*/] from user
2. Get operands (x and y) from user
3. Calculate result
4. Print result


-- EXTENSIONS --
These are ideas for extending the program.
If you have any ideas of your own feel free to go ahead with those.

- Implement a loop to allow for multiple calculations after
  the first one is done.
- Save the result from the last calculation in a variable. Now make this
  previous result accessible with a special symbol in the operand input stage.
  This way you can chain together calculations.
- Implement support for more operators, for example exponentation (^)
  and square root (âˆš).
- Handle errors, for example invalid input and division by zero.
- Implement support for functions, for example sin() or log().

# Step 1: Get operator from the user.
# These include [+-*/]
# Relevant skills: I/O with input() and print() functions and understanding of variables.



# Step 2: Get operands from the user
# These are the x and y in an expression like x + y
# Relevant skills: type conversion (converting strings to numbers).



# Step 3: Calculate the result
# Use the operator and the operands to calculate the result
# Relevant skills: if/else statements for conditional execution based on the operator chosen.



# Step 4: Print the result
# Print the result in a nicely formatted way
